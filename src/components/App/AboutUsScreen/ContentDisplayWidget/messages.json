Backed by over 27 years of hands-on fabric development experience, Luca has worked shoulder to shoulder with local teams on the factory floor—carefully inspecting fabrics, resolving production challenges, and refining every detail to ensure each textile meets the highest standards. From late nights managing production to last-minute quality checks before shipment, Luca and her team have embedded a culture of care, precision, and accountability into every step of the process. These values have shaped Corlee into a trusted development partner for international sportswear and activewear brands around the world. Sustainability isn’t just a word—it’s part of everything we do.
